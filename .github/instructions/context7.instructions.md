## Examples of using `context7`
This project uses [Semantic Kernel](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel) to create a custom AI agent that can access your APIs, MCP tools, or orchestrate multiple agents. The solution is designed to be extensible and customizable, allowing you to tailor the agent's behavior to your specific needs.
- When making updates or changes to the code, please ensure that you follow the Semantic Kernel guidelines and best practices and follow the SDK. This will help maintain the integrity and performance of the agent.
- It is important to not assume methods are available, so you can use `context7` to check for the latest updates and changes in the project.
- You can also use `context7` to check for any known issues or bugs in the project, which can help you avoid potential pitfalls and ensure a smoother development process.
- As the packages like Semantic Kernel are updated, you can use `context7` to check for any breaking changes or deprecations that may affect your code.
- If you are unsure about how to use a specific feature or component of the project, `context7` can provide examples and code snippets to help you get started.
